#
# This is a simple example of a certificate request
# If you leave out any of the `dn` values, defaults
# will be pulled from the CA configuration file, so
# beware !!
#
# This supports only very basic functionality. You
# can create a certificate with a simple distinguished
# name only or you can create a certificate with a
# subject alternative names section. Subject alterative
# names go under the `alt_names` section and can be either
# IP or DNS alternative names
#
# From this file, an openssl.cnf file will be produced and
# processed by the CA, producing a signed certificate and a
# corresponding private key
#
#
# Remember you don't need to have an IP or Hostname as a CN
# In this example, imagine a fleet of mobile systems that
# need to authenticate on a many to one case to a central
# server. Each endpoint might receive this certificate and key
# simply to provide best effort authentication to exposed log
# collectors
